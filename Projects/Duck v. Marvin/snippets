Number everything as -1
Lava is marked as -2
Phosdex is 0; Start with it in queue
Marvin and Duck is 0;

Current location is P change P to location that is +1 from P after assigning value of (p+1) only if they are -1




//

Look at number at Duck Dodgers
	if -1 he can't reach

Look at number at Marvin
	if -1 he can't reach

//

Add current locatiion to end of list
	look at any place 1 less then current location
	add cell location to list
//

Check for smaller distance

//

Incase of Tie or Duck Losing (Marvin wins Ties)
	Use Gandalf
	copy marvin path elsewhere
	number Gandalf as -3
	try gandalf in each location on Marvin's path
	Output the longer path if
	Gandalf also blocks duck

//

Columns have up and down

Rows have left and right
	Even column numbers have down left and down right
	Odd column numbers have up left and up right
